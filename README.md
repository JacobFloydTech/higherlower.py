# higherlower.py

Simple higher-lower game made in Python 3.6

Consists of two modes: 

Option 1: Limited amount of rounds

Option 2: Unlimited amount of rounds (counts up)

The program also adds each of the guesses to a list, then checks to see if the new guess is the same as any in that list to 
prevent the user from entering the same number twice.
